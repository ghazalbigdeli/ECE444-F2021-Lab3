A functional requirement I would like to improve is have a list of courses appear even if one of the fields is missing an input. For example, if the user filled out the search term but did not choose a specific course year, the system should display courses from all years that fit the search term.

A non-functional requirement I would like to improve is the usability. The system does not have a lot of visual clarity. After searching a term, the list of courses is shown with no separation between each course, causing the descriptions to merge together and look like a wall of text. I would like to add more visual clarity by separating the course information properly and making it easier to read.
